# Stock info website/webapplication

This project is a small webapp two peers and I made during a one week sprint while learning web basics.

The website allows users to:
  * create an account
  * log in/log out
  * search for stocks
  * add them to a watchlist
  * when selecting a stock it shows info about the stock, the company, the past price and news

It uses multiple APIs like yahoo stocks, and stock news and more.
